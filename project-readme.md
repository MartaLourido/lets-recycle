# Project's name

## Description
My project consists of an interactive recycling game, in which in the first level there is simply a bin and it rains recyclable waste and you have to pick it up with the bin.
In the possible improvement, there will be three bins and you will have to change the color of the bin depending on the type of trash that falls: plastic, paper, organic...

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
-The game has a bin wich can that moves horizontally
-The trash falls vertically
-The trash appears from the top of the screen
-The player will score points as he/she picks up trash, 1 item = 1 point.


## Backlog

-I have to add a scoreboard
-Improve the game with colored bins to choose according to the type of trash that falls
